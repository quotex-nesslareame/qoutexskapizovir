## Mobile Trading Specifics

The Quotex mobile app offers all of the same features as the web-based
platform. However, there are a few specific considerations to keep in
mind when trading on a mobile device.

-   **Screen size:** The screen size of a mobile device is smaller than
    the screen size of a computer. This means that you may need to zoom
    in and out to see all of the information on the screen.
-   **Touch controls:** Mobile devices use touch controls instead of a
    mouse and keyboard. This can take some getting used to, but it is
    generally easy to learn.

## Bonuses and Promo Codes

Quotex offers a variety of bonuses and promo codes to new and existing
traders. These bonuses and promo codes can help you to increase your
trading profits.
